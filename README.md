# Ini.ahk
### Version: 1.0 Release
Ini.ahk aims to be an easy to use utility for interacting with .ini files.
It uses ahks IniRead and IniWrite for interaction, so their limitations apply.

The project began as just a wrapper for those commands in expression syntax but
it now also works natively with ahk arrays, allowing you to just dump 2 dimensional
arrays and read the hole ini into one 2d array.

On how to use this lib, have a look for the example folder.
